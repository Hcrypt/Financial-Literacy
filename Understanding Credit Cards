- Interest:
Interest is a fee you pay to burrow money.
Interest can also be paid to you for having a bank account or going through some kind of finicial service through an institution.
But generally, it is a fee you pay to borrow money.

Interest rates on credit cards tend to be pretty high.

A high interest rate would usually be 8% or higher.
For credit cards, interest rate would typically be 15% and can go up to 25%. Possibly even higher.

- Fixed Interest Rate:
A fixed interest rate means that it's interest rate is going to stay the same for the life of the loan or the debt.

For example, if the interest rate agreed is 5%, this means that for the entire life of the loan the interest won't change.
This is typically the case for things like mortgages, personal loans and car loans.

- Variable Interest Rate:
A variable interest rate means that the interest rate can change during the life of the loan.
So with credit cards the interest rate is a variable.
It's considered risky and it can lead to an increase in your monthly payment increase to your interest charge.

With a variable rate, there is usually a range.
For a credit card, the rate or the range might be 15% - 25% interest.

So this means that on January your interest might be 15%, but then 6 months later in June, your interest rate can change into 20%.
This would mean that instead of being charged 15% on balances, you're now going to be charged 20% interest on balances.

_____________________________________________

One the ways to avoid paying interest is to pay off the balance of the credit card within the billing cycle which is typically 30 days.
This means that if you were to pay off the balance before the end of 30 days, the bank is not going to charged interest because interest is charged at the end of the 30 days.

_____________________________________________

What is "Annual Percentage Rate" (APR)?

APR is the annual interest rate on your account.

How do you read the interet charged by transactions????

If balance is $5317.37
and APR is 15.24%

.1524 * (5317.37 / 12) = $66.61 (Interest Charged)

The higher the interest rate, the higher the amount of interest we're going to be charged.

So if the interest rate (APR in this case) is 20%, then your finanace charge is going to be alot higher also.
That also means, if the balance charge is higher, then the finanace charge is going to be higher because we're taking interest rate and we're calculating at a higher balance.

It's good to understand this incase in order to back your debt IF you miss a payment

Late Payment Penalty:

Typically, you want to pay on time every month.
If you missed the payment, the credit card company is going to charge you a fee.
This fee is called the "Late Payment Penalty" fee.

Example:
If the payment is due on the 5th of every month and that payment is not paid on the 5th, then bank is going to charge you an amount usually between 25 and 35 dollars.

Late fees can worsten you forget your payments.
As a result, the interest rate could also be incresed an the total amount of money you pay back to the bank can significantly increase if you continiously miss payments.

In addition, the bank can report you to the credit card reporting agencies as this can prevent or limit your ability to borrow money in the future.
And this can come into play for things like car loans, home loans and personal loans and so managing your credit card debt or any debt in general is very important to your "credit profile" as it can have huge impacts on your overall on your credit profile.

Example of a Late Payment Penalty:
- Monthly payment is not made on credit card with a balance of $100.00
- Bank decides to charge $35.00 late penalty and increases interest from 15% to 20%.
- Now the amount you owed is $140.00

This is because
20% of $200 is $40

.02 * 200 = 40

Now imagine if you were to constantly miss your payment every month and kept being charged $35.
That would mean your overall balance each month is going to continue to increase and increase until it's out of control.
That's how major debt is accumulated.
That's why it's always good to manage your cedit card payments and any debt.

You want to have a plan to pay it off as far as you can.
And you want to make sure that you know when repayments are and pay the payments on time.

PROS on Credit Cards -
* Can make large purchases now and pay off over time
* Build credit (Banks look at this when they want to issue things like mortgages and different kinds of financial services to you)
* Can earn rewards
* Help pay for emergency expenses

If you pay your credit card on time, banks look at this as you're a less risky borrow and you have a good financial standing.

CONS on Credit Cards -
* Can easily get into debt as it can cause you to overspend
* Missing payments result in fee and increase in interest rate
* Very expensive to carry balance long term
* Interest rate varies which means rate could change each month.

Unlike some loans, credit cards interest rate varies which means that its not set at a specific rate so it can be 15% one year and the next year, it could be 20%.

Ofcourse the higher the interest rate, the higher costs for you to borrow money from the bank and so it's risky and it's unpredictable.
It's defintely something that you want to want to manage correctly.

VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER & NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT'S ONLY RISKY WHEN YOU LACK FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SKILLS.

Credit Card vs Debit Card

Credit Card -
* Money is burrowed which means you may have to pay interest and fees
* Can gain rewards if used with discipline
* Reflect on credit report

Debit Card -
* Money is not burrowed. Funds are pulled directly from your checking account.
* No rewards attached
* Fees are limited and less expensive. Sometimes no fees at all. If their is a fee, it's usually $10 - $15 dollars.
* Less risk than credit card

"Overdrafted Fees" on the Debit Card can avoided and it typically don't cost as much as "Late Charge Penalty Fees" for credit cards.
It's basically the same thing.

The psychology in this is, typically, when it's your own, you take better care of it.
All that means is if you use the credit card as your own and you know when to give and when to take, you should be ok with it.

______________________________________________________________

Recap -

* Cards are issued by bank/financial institution that alows you to borrow money
* Interest rates are high and it is a risky debt

Interest rates tend to be pretty high usually between 15% - 25% when it comes to debt.
Credit Card debt is considered to be risky debt in the financial world and it is a debt that most people would advise to stay from.

But the best advice is for you to use a credit card, but to manage it and have a plan with your spending.

If credit card debt is not managed it can lead to significant finacial trouble. Credit card debt can spiral out of control easily and with all the interest rates and fees attached to the credit card debt on the balance can increase significantly from month to month.
